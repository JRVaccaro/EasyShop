# Easy Shop

## üöÄDescription of the ProjectüöÄ

Welcome to EasyShop! Your go-to shopping cart API built with Java & Spring Boot! üõí‚ú®

This project lets logged-in users easily add, update, and manage products in their shopping cart. Whether you want to add that cool gadget, update quantities, peek at what‚Äôs in your cart, or just clear it out, this API has got you covered! üí™


## Interesting Code Snippet
@Test
@WithMockUser(username = "tater", roles = {"USER"})
void clearCart_ShouldReturn200() throws Exception {
// Create a fake User object to simulate userDao behavior
User user = new User();
user.setId(1);
user.setUsername("tater");

    // Mock userDao to return the fake user when "tater" is queried
    Mockito.when(userDao.getByUserName("tater")).thenReturn(user);

    // Perform DELETE request on cart and expect HTTP 200 OK response
    mockMvc.perform(delete("/cart"))
           .andExpect(status().isOk());
